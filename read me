Smart Agriculture System Based On IoT
Category: Internet Of Things

Project Description:

Smart Agriculture System based on IoT can monitor soil moisture and climatic conditions to grow and yield a good crop.
The farmer can also get the realtime weather forecasting data by using external platforms like Open Weather API.
Farmer is provided a mobile app using which he can monitor the temperature,humidity and soil moisture parameters along with weather forecasting details.
Based on all the parameters he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application.
Even if the farmer is not present near his crop he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application from anywhere.
Here we are using the Online IoT simulator for getting the Temperature,Humidity and Soil Moisture values.
